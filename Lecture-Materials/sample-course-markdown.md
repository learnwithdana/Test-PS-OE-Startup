# Introduction to Some-Live-PS-Class

Welcome to the Introduction to Some-Live-PS-Class class where we will teach you how to build a fort
by finding pillows and blankets, arranging living room furniture in a circle, and then covering them with blanksts 

## Part 1
The most important part is to find pillows and blankets that won't get you in trouble.
Don't grab them off existing beds... especially your parent's bed.

You can run the following command to invoke the Blanket-Finding-Genii
```
genii find blankets
```

## Part 2
You must now build the infastructure for your fort.  Since the couch is heavy, we suggest you don't move it.

You can run the following command to invoke the Fort-Building-Genii
```
genii place chair 30,30
genii place chair 30,60
genii spread blanket from couch to chairs
```

## Part 3
Crawl inside and enjoy your fort!  If you are over 30, you can hide here and take a nap!  Just don't snore!
